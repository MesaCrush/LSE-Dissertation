    simulate other market makers' behaviours, note they always quote both bid and ask in the market at the same time
    there are 2 types of market makers
    1) insiders (sophisticated traders): their quote price are correlated with BIM (first step, can add complexity, e.g. spread, traded volume)
       idea is: if there are more bid qty in the market, i.e. more buyer, we will expect the market moves up, 
       so the market maker will raise their quotes if bim > 0.5, and vice versa
       
    2) uninformed market maker: quote prices are randomized
       idea is the market makers' expectation of the fair price follows a geometric brownian motion, which is widely used to model financial prices 
       then, they quote bid and ask around their expected fair price, the spread is the current market spread * a random multiplier
