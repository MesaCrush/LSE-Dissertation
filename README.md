## Algorithmic Trading Project
This project uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make trading decisions in the stock market.

Here's what it does:

  - It creates a simulated trading environment.
  - It trains RL agents to buy and sell stocks in this environment.
  - The RL system learns to make decisions based on market information.
  - The project tests how well the RL performs in trading.

The goal is to see if RL can develop good trading strategies that make money while managing risks.

Key parts of the project:

  - Different types of RL methods are used (DQN and A2C).
  - The project can be adjusted easily by changing settings.
  - It measures how well the RL does using things like profit and trading behavior.
